SPEAKER 1: To answer your question, the Internet of Things
is when we connect up everyday physical things to the internet.
Yes, even things like shoes.
These things can give us information that can be used to improve your life
or your business or the environment.
Well, yes.
Your boot can tell us things about you, or it, or the places you've walked,
and where you are right now.
It's going to be another Industrial Revolution.
You'd better get ready.
Not a bad revolution, but like when computers
arrived and changed everything.
The Internet of Things means the internet doesn't just
collect and distribute information.
It can also feel and intelligently respond.
What were you looking for?
You can't see the internet of things working.
Ah, your boot.
You think your boot has connected to the internet and booked itself a holiday.
No, that's not how it works.
Though, if you'd been working too hard, your shoe
could send data to the internet cloud, where it would be analyzed,
and then a message would be sent to your boss
to say that it was time for you to have a holiday.
Yeah, it's pretty good, isn't it?

#### Module 1: What in the world is the Internet of Things?   1.1 What in the world is the Internet of Things?   Evolution of the internet

https://youtu.be/ReC_s8DJYLI

IAIN MURRAY: Welcome.
I'm Iain Murray, and I'm a Professor of Electrical
and Computer Engineering at Curtin University.
And I'll be taking you through the Introduction to The Internet of Things.
My interest in the IoT comes from my background
in computer systems engineering.
I've been dealing with the internet basically
from the very early days when it was just
a group of academic machines all hooked together with email
and very little else that you could do with it.
The internet's evolved to a platform where we can share information.
We can find out facts.
We can meet with our friends.
We can have tele-conferences and talk to friends and relatives that
may be miles away.

The internet is changing.
And it's changing in profound ways.
It's no longer just a means of communication.
We can use the internet to connect things that we wouldn't normally
think of putting onto the network, things
like your fridge for a simple example.
Find out when your milk's going off and when you need to order some more.
But it's more than that, much more.
In medical areas, in manufacturing, in agriculture, the internet of things
is going to change the way we do things.
It gathers information.
It processes that information and presents it back
to human beings in a way they can understand.
In the background, there's a lot of communication going on
between the machines-- machine to machine communication.
And we'll be looking closely at how this happens.
And that automates the processes so that humans can do what they do best,
make decisions on valid data.

The internet of things is just in its very beginning stages.
We're starting to see the connection of devices.
We're starting to see some places where the data is
being collected, and processed, and used in different ways.
So you may be wondering what the internet of things can do for us.
Well, it can automate things.
It can make our life easier.
It can gather massive amounts of data that a human being can't really
cope with, but we can use that to predict
what we need to do in the future.
We can look at trends.
We can take actions before failures occur,
and generally just help us do a better job of what we're
doing now by embracing automation.

So the Internet of Things-- it's wonderful.
It's going to cure all of our problems.
It's a solution to all of our worries in the world.
No, it's not.
It is going to cause us some issues.
Some of those issues include the security.
We all know about cybersecurity threats and how
hackers try to get into your computer.
Well, imagine when we've got 20 billion extra devices connected
to the internet.
That's 20 billion more devices for hackers to try and get into.
It's a real issue.
And we'll be looking very closely at the security.
If we're gathering all of this data, and there's lots of data we're gathering,
and it can be personal, and you can be walking past a sign,
and it'll announce you should go into this shop
because there's something in there that's of interest,
do we really want that invasion into our private space?
Do we want other people to know how we're
going to keep this information away from people
we don't want to find out about it?

The Internet of Things will also cause a major disruption in employment.
There will be a change.
People will be losing their jobs.
But the good news is far more jobs will be created in the area.
These jobs will require a higher skill level.
Instead of the person who's manufacturing cars just tightening
bolts, they will need to be able to maintain the robotics,
or control the production line, monitor the dashboards
of the information that's being collected from the manufacturing line.
So the jobs will be far more skilled, which probably
means they will be better paid.
But there will be far fewer of them.
And this is an issue we need to confront.

So you may be asking yourself where will this impact?
Where will the greatest impact be in the near future?
Well, I've got no idea.
And I don't think anyone really has.
This is something that we've got to explore.
We've got to look at where will the resources that we save be used.
Will we just save resources and not use that benefit?
I wouldn't think so.
So we really need to start examining where the impact will be
and what these savings will actually mean to industries.
Right, so, generally, that's the Internet of Things.
Let's now have a look at some applications and case studies
of the Internet of Things in the real world.

#### Module 1: What in the world is the Internet of Things?   1.2 Urban IoT: Smart cities, buildings, and transport   Designing buildings that think

### Designing buildings that think

Let’s zoom in now, from the concept of smart cities, to how IoT can be used to create smart buildings.


> The term “smart building” is loosely tossed around a lot, but it generally refers to network-enabled building management systems that help automate building operations.
> These technologies, once considered revolutionary, are steadily becoming the norm in today’s premier office buildings… a smart building can have substantial benefits, including: lower costs, saving time, and simply promoting a greater sense of comfort and ease to employees.
> (Barendrecht, 2017)

Coen van Oostrom is a Dutch entrepreneur and champion of sustainability and smart technology who describes himself on Twitter as a ‘global disruptor of real estate’. His company, OVG, has repeatedly won sustainability awards for its smart buildings; their mission is to ‘create healthier working, living and learning environments by using smart technology’ (OVG, 2017).

Please watch the following 2016 TEDex talk given by van Oostrom about:

* the catalyst for his company designing green buildings;
* how OVG set out to build the most sustainable building in the world: ‘The Edge’;
* how The Edge’s sensors work to assist building space management, cleaning management, and air quality.

#### Module 1: What in the world is the Internet of Things?   1.2 Urban IoT: Smart cities, buildings, and transport   Autonomous vehicles

### Autonomous vehicles

In recent years our cars have been incrementally advancing alongside developing technologies - from cruise control and GPS navigation systems, to blue-tooth connectivity and parking sensors. When talking about IoT in terms of transport, you’ve probably heard of smart cars and autonomous (or driverless) vehicles. The concept of cars being able to drive themselves without human assistance is now a reality. As autonomous vehicles on the roads become more of a reality, they will disrupt the way we live. The projection of the evolution to autonomous vehicles provides us with a tangible example of how and why IoT-style technologies will be pervasive and disruptive.

Please watch the following interviews with Professor Simone Pettigrew, Paul Nicholls and Dr Scott Hollier, who introduce some of the issues around autonomous vehicles, and some of the benefits and potential drawbacks.

https://youtu.be/MOCnKl8_orM

SIMONE PETTIGREW: So autonomous vehicles feel new to most of us
as if we haven't heard much about them, but they've actually
been in progress for quite some time.
So the technological aspects of the development of the vehicles
have been tinkering away in the background for decades.
And if you think about the way that your vehicle works today
compared to what your parents might have experienced,
even the fact that they probably drive a manual and you
drive an automatic vehicle now.
So we've been seeing progressive improvements even down to your airbags
pop up automatically now if you have an accident.
But we have cruise control.
We've got little devices in the car that center us in the lane
if we want to use those kinds of devices.
Some cars are capable of self-parking, others flash and indicate to us
when we're getting too close to other objects.
So incrementally we've been increasing the amount of autonomous content
within a vehicle.
It's just a matter of time until we take that extra leap and the vehicles
become fully autonomous, which means that we won't need a steering wheel,
we won't need brakes or accelerators.
The vehicles will do all the driving for us.
They will be GPS based.
So we just tell them either verbally or program it in where we want to go
and the vehicle will be capable of taking us there.
So that's kind of like the end goal.
And because the vehicle will be talking to lots of other vehicles
it can assess the extent to which there are blockages in traffic
and pick different routes depending on the fastest possible available route
available at that point in time, depending
on how other many road users there are all trying to get to the same place.
So it really will be interesting times once
we move to the other end, the full end of the autonomous spectrum.
At the moment we have the capability for vehicles to be autonomous,
but there are kind of constraining factors
that are preventing that from happening right now.
And one of the major ones is the fact that we've got hundreds of road rules
all of which specify the driver.
So until those road rules can be changed we're still going to be in a situation
where we're not allowed to drive autonomous
vehicles in full autonomous mode.
However, within the next three or four years
we're looking at sort of certain precincts
probably being able to do that on Curtin campus, for instance,
we have our autonomous bus.
And that's allowed to be in autonomous mode because of the fact
that it's largely on private property.
So we'll kind of see individual areas, geographical areas introducing
autonomous vehicles first.
PAUL NICHOLLS: Hi.
I'm Paul Nicholls.
I'm the Director of Strategic Projects Research and Development
here at Curtin University, Perth, Western Australia.
This is Kip, our AV bus that we've had operating for about three months now
on the Curtin University campus.
The bus is called Kip after the Curtin University namesake.
So John Curtin.
Kip was the name of one of his dogs.
Curtin's purchased an AV bus because we think
it's a great way for us to trial these sorts of disruptive technologies.
The same as mobile phones have disrupted the way we operate.
And the internet has created all of these opportunities
to do things differently.
An AV bus can really disrupt the way that we operate in a community.
SIMONE PETTIGREW: In terms of when we might
look at having loads of different autonomous vehicles on the roads,
they say by about 2040 we may have around 3/4
of vehicles in fully autonomous mode.
So I think we can see quite rapid adoption of autonomous vehicles
coming up in the future.
But this is also an evidence based proposition
if you like because if you think back to the early 1900s
when the motorcar was first introduced, we've
got the situation where in New York City, for instance, in the year 1900
you had the Main Street with one car and all the rest being horse and carts.
13 years later, we've got the situation where
there's one horse and cart surrounded by motor vehicles.
So even back then in the space of 13 years
there was complete saturation of a new disruptive transport technology.
So if we extrapolate that out now to the 2000s,
and we're even more receptive to new technology
it's going to be more affordable relatively than it was back then.
I think we're looking at really fast adoption rates.
The future with autonomous vehicles will look
very different to the way it does now.
So in the interim period we'll probably still have things like traffic lights,
but the flows should be much better.
Ultimately, however, we're looking at a situation
where there are no traffic lights and those vehicles down to the millimeter
can be pinpointed.
They'll be each talking to more than 30 satellites,
as well as communicating with each other.
So they are perfectly well programmed to be able to mix in with each other
again down to the millimeter.
So you're looking at a situation of intersections
without traffic lights and traffic just merging.
So you'd have traffic coming from different directions
just blending it and keeping on going.
And I know that's a difficult concept to get your head around,
but longer term the computers are very well set up to be able to do that.
So for instance, traffic control at the moment for airplanes already does that.
We have the airplanes in the sky on automatic pilot for much of the flight
and we have computers determining when and where they're
going to pass other flights and when and where they are going to land.
So we do put our faith in these machines in some areas.
It's just going to be a matter of transferring that to motor vehicles
and getting used to that new system.
The logistics around that, of course, are
interesting because we're looking at a situation
where all the frequencies have to be the same.
So all the vehicles have to be talking to each other on the same frequency.
If only one vehicle has its GPS out by a few millimeters
it could create absolute havoc.
So we really need to have the system set up well enough so that they're
talking to each other with perfect compatibility,
that all of those vehicles are registering their location in exactly
the same way, and are able to communicate that to each other
immediately.
We'll have lots of spinoff benefits from that as well.
So the vehicles, as well as having their own senses
that can tell them what's in the immediate environment.
They can tap into what other vehicles are sensing.
So if there are potholes, if there are road signs missing,
if there are road works, the vehicles can immediately
communicate that to the network rather than each individual vehicle
having to learn each time it passes by that particular scene.
We can have huge savings in terms of trip times.
So we're very much looking at a blended system in order for it
to be as efficient as possible.
It would be quite inefficient if every individual wanted
to own their own autonomous vehicle, we would just end up with a whole bunch
more vehicles on the road.
So for instance, your vehicle would drive you
into the city in the morning to go to work.
It would turn around and drive itself home again, or take itself
somewhere else to recharge.
It would then come and collect you in the evening and take you home.
So rather than that vehicle just being on the road while you're in it,
it's now also on the road for quite a while you're not in it.
So multiply that out by the number of people in the population
and there's the potential for increases in congestion instead of decreases.
So we're very keen for public policy makers our governments to be proactive
in this space to make sure that we encourage
the rollout of autonomous vehicles in such a way
that we do prioritize public transport.
So we've got really good efficient public transport that
runs autonomously, as well as those backup last mile, first mile
services that can help people so that they
don't have to actually own a vehicle, but they can still
get really good transport to and from.
And then to have their own individual autonomous vehicle as the backup,
as the last thing that you would consider.
PAUL NICHOLLS: In the future, Curtin University
hopes to have a range of autonomous vehicles operating across the campus.
It'll help improve the experience of our students and the guests to the campus,
but also improve their safety.
Over time we expect that the level of autonomy of these vehicles
will actually improve to the point where we can take our technicians out
of the system and where we can go fully autonomous on the campus.
The vehicles we hope will be able to identify
where students are on the campus that need to be moved and actually
optimize the movement of those students across the campus.

SIMONE PETTIGREW: Probably the most substantial benefit
that we can gain from autonomous vehicles is accident reduction.
Around 93% of all accidents are just down to human error.
So we go through stop signs or red lights.
We don't see oncoming traffic, et cetera.
Autonomous vehicles are expected to eradicate almost all
of those accidents.
In Australia, we lose about 1,200 people a year who die on the roads.
If we can get rid of 93% of those accidents,
you're saving more than 1,000 lives per year.
The other consideration, of course, are people
who don't die, but end up in hospital.
Often, they're quite severe accidents, and they can be in rehab
for the rest of their lives.
We have, again, about 34,000 Australians end up
in hospital due to traffic accidents each year.
If we can get rid of 93% of those hospital visits,
that would be freeing up entire hospital wings and rehabilitation centers.
The ongoing benefits to society will be huge,
as well as for those individuals who won't be
harmed who would have been otherwise.
The cost savings are expected to be around $16 billion a year
just in crash prevention alone.
If we think about the fact that we have an aging population,
and it's aging rapidly.
We've got that huge baby boomer segment that's
just entered the retirement years.
Autonomous vehicles are understood to be a huge boon for this group.
They'll actually be able to stay a lot more mobile for a lot longer
once they can use vehicles that don't rely on their faculties
to be able to drive.
So lots of potential there to do lots of wonderful things
to help people who are really quite disadvantaged, particularly,
say, blind people, who have never had the opportunity to go anywhere
on their own in a vehicle, would be able to, with voice activation,
just be able to program a vehicle to take them wherever they wanted to go.
SCOTT HOLLIER: I'm Dr Scott Hollier.
I'm a digital access specialist.
I've worked in the corporate government and not-for-profit sectors
for about 15 years, and a big part of my focus
is to ensure that people with disabilities
get access to computers and internet-related technologies.
Autonomous vehicles offer a huge potential for people with disabilities.
As a legally blind person, I'm very much looking forward to the day
when I'll be able to jump into an autonomous vehicle
and it can take me to where I want to go.
It's not only beneficial in terms of getting me somewhere,
but it also helps to address issues that I face now, such as my current need
to live near public transport.
It's exciting to that if I did have a driverless car an autonomous vehicle
that I could potentially live anywhere because I'm no longer restricted
by that need to be close to shops or close to public transport.
So the benefits would really open up for someone such as myself.
I think one of the benefits of autonomous vehicles
is that it does provide a lot of independence.
Again, to use myself as an example, to have the ability
to just pop to the shops, or be able to go watch my son play soccer,
or my daughter play golf, without the need
to have significant coordination of going places, given that I can't drive,
it would be great to be able to just jump in the car
and go places, something which I can't do at the moment.
So I think it does give you a lot of flexibility, a lot of independence.
The timing becomes a lot easier.
For people, for example, who use a wheelchair
and rely a lot on wheelchair taxis, autonomous vehicles
mean they'd be able to better manage the time.
They don't have to rely on how quickly or how far away a taxi is,
and be able to just go in something and do what you want to do.
So it would significantly help in relation to independence.
SIMONE PETTIGREW: Like every other innovation,
there are going to be downsides.
And we're going to need to work through those to make sure
that they're not disadvantaging people.
So as we said, one of them is that perhaps people
will end up using cars more rather than less,
because they've become more dependent on them, because they're so convenient.
Other risks include things like carjacking,
where you could worry about people who are very technology-savvy infiltrating
a system and commanding vehicles to all turn 90 degrees right now and run
into brick walls or people.
Those kinds of scenarios are very unlikely.
We have lots of agencies in Australia and internationally
that are working very hard on making sure that those kinds of issues
don't occur, and perhaps think back to our airplane
example, in that those systems also have to be hijack-proof.
So we are accustomed to coming up with systems to get around that,
but it does take a lot of effort and some very big brains
out there to be working on that constantly,
and to be preempting any kind of problems that may occur.
PAUL NICHOLLS: One of the great things about autonomous vehicle trials
is it also helps us to better understand the privacy
concerns of the people that use it.
With an autonomous vehicle trial, there are
lots of sensors collecting lots of information about the individuals.
There are cameras on board the actual system.
There are cameras on the external of the system.
We actually are very careful to make sure
that people are aware that their data is being collected.
SIMONE PETTIGREW: We've been surveying Australians for the last year or so.
We've surveyed around 1,600 Australian drivers aged 16-plus,
and we've said to them, what do you know about autonomous vehicles?
How do you feel about them?
What do you think the biggest positives are?
What do you think the biggest negatives are?
Fortunately, the overall attitude seems to be reasonably neutral.
So on a five-point scale, most people were kind of around three saying,
I think I'm interested, but I'm really not
quite sure what's involved with this.
So there's a huge opportunity there for public education
so that people are better informed.
Where they did express benefits and concerns, the benefits, in general,
outweighed the concerns.
So they tended to see more positives than they could see negatives.
And by far, the biggest positive is this ability for immobile people
to be able to be freed up to go where they want to go.
The biggest concern that people have, interestingly, is around job losses.
So they're very aware, of course, that autonomous vehicles
will no longer require drivers.
So if you're a truck driver, if you're a taxi, or an Uber driver,
if you're a courier, you won't have a job in the longer term
once all vehicles are automated.
So people are quite aware that that's going to be an outcome.
And again, that brings us back to our governments
being very proactive in this space and seeing that this is coming,
and making sure that we have kind of retraining or other opportunities
available for people.
And overall, internationally, the big studies
have shown that the net employment outcome is going to be positive.
We're going to have more jobs rather than fewer,
but they're going to be based in IT.
Connected autonomous vehicles are coming.
There's no doubt about it.
We're going to have them here.
And it's a really, really good thing.
They're going to have amazing effects in terms of almost completely
eradicating traffic accidents, in terms of allowing people who otherwise can't
be mobile to be independent and get where they need to go,
in terms of reducing the number of emissions,
so that we've actually got a much healthier city to live in, and also
in terms of flexibility, allowing us to use our travel time for leisure
or for additional work to increase our productivity.
They're going to be a real boon.
They're going to change the way our cities are laid out.
They're going to change the way that our homes look.
Will they have a garage?
Or will they not, if we're using group vehicles?
The ability of those vehicles to talk to each other
will increase the efficiency of our road systems and reduce congestion.
So it's a good thing.

Here at Curtin University, we have been the first Australian university to trial a commercial driverless bus. Named Kip, after John Curtin’s pet kelpie dog, the bus runs entirely on electricity, and uses input digital programming, remote sensors, and GPS to determine its route and navigate obstacles.

https://youtu.be/jAZWWFe4fAI

>> I think it's a fantastic opportunity
for Curtin to show the state, the country and
the world that as an early adopter, this is
what a University should be about.
>> I think the moral and the safety issues of
driverless vehicles is actually important here.
>> Control is probably the
biggest stumbling block that we're going
to face in terms of human psychology and
increasing the adoption of autonomous vehicles.
>> It's just a question of how
many decisions will we let the vehicle
make for us and I think we will
eventually get to a point of the vehicle
making all the decisions for us.
>> Having an autonomous vehicle on a
University provides a safe environment
in which we can test this brand-new technology.
>> We're very interested in the
extent to which autonomous vehicles are
going to change society as a whole but
specifically in terms of the health
outcomes and they are vast and probably
completely underestimated at this point in time.
>> I'm really interested in
people's responses to the bus and to
the technology, answering questions like
will they perceive it as a danger to
public safety or do they think that it's
perfectly safe? How do they respond to
the idea of a vehicle with clearly no
driver here in this vehicle?
>> I like the idea of The Internet of Things
driving this because the bus can be a
thing on the internet where users can
interact in the way that potentially
creates new business environment.
>> I see the benefits on both sides, we get to work
with the University and understand how
we can solve some challenging problems
that we can see within our important
customers, but at the same time the
University can actually leverage a lot of
the solutions that we're working with
in a sort of a rapid prototype approach.
>> Having this kind of technology available
on Curtin campus enables us to watch
humans interacting with the technology,
so how do they feel about the technology
prior to exposure, how do they feel about
it afterwards, what are the sticking points,
what are the things that we need to
educate them about or tell them about to
enable them to be more accepting, longer
term of the technology.
>> The cars, the autonomous cars of the future will be
covered in sensors and they will have
all that information being fed into
effectively a machine learning device
that will make very good decisions.
>> So if you think about the fact that
we've got about 1,200 people a year
dying on Australian roads and another 35
thousand or so who end up in hospital,
that's close to 16 billion dollars
worth of expenditure just dealing with
that road trauma. The forecasts are that
when we have autonomous vehicles, they're
going to all but eradicate those costs
because most accidents are the result of
human error and that human error will
be taken out of the equation.
>> There's a lot more to it than just passenger
vehicles on the road. I think if you
apply the same ideas, autonomous vehicle
technology to trucks, to buses, to trains...
>> and with that will go all the supply
chain optimisation as well, so we'll
become much more efficient as how we
move things around the state.
>> It's all about the new era of mobility and
transportation, you don't have to buy car insurance
anymore, you don't have to worry about
parking in the big city.
>> The other kinds
of health benefits that we're looking at
are just the fact that people who
become socially isolated due to illness
or age because they can no longer hold
a license, they'll actually be able to stay mobile.
>> Well for a start I
think my kids are probably the last
generation that will need to get a driver's
license, which has always been a bit of a
teenage right of passage but that's gone.
The school run in the morning will
disappear, you'll just whistle for the
car, it'll pick the kids up and take them
off to school, having to leave work early
for soccer practice, all of that sort of
stuff will disappear. So parents who
feel like a taxi service will probably
appreciate the technology.
>> Having that bus here gives us a great opportunity to
develop new solutions and then hopefully
we can take those solutions and export
them globally.

#### Module 1: What in the world is the Internet of Things?   1.3 IoT case studies   IoT case study: Sydney Harbour Bridge

Throughout this course, and the overall MicroMasters in IoT, we will be using case studies to showcase authentic, real-life examples of how the Internet of Things is being used across different types of businesses and industries. Our aim is to demonstrate how the IoT really can connect up all things, and in doing so, contribute to safer environments, and create efficiencies that save time, money, energy and other resources.

### CASE STUDY: Sydney Harbour Bridge

The first case study we will consider is the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Opened in March 1932, the iconic bridge is subjected to enormous amounts of traffic, and has traditionally been monitored by inspectors.

Watch the video below to learn how the IoT and thousands of sensors have now given the bridge its own ‘voice’.

I remember coming to Sydney thirteen years ago.
The entryway from the north into
Sydney is through this great bridge.
It was built to a great engineering
standard but it still needs to be
monitored and looked at.
[Music]
What we've seen over the years is an
increase in volume of vehicles. The weight of
trucks towing lots of freight and what
we're trying to do is understand how the
bridge responds to different loading and
making sure that that bridge will be
able to accommodate those changes
To conditions and loading uses over time.
Rhodes Maritime Services came to us
and said how can we manage Sydney
Harbour Bridge? Currently we send
inspectors, he said, but it would be really
good to have some sensors or some sort of
technology to help us get an early
warning if some maintenance is needed. And
we ended up with the technology where we
could basically give the bridge oa voice.
The bridge could tell the asset manager
when the bridge needs attention. We have
this fiber-optic network going the
length of the bridge with 3200 sensors
underneath the bridge. As vehicles
travel over the bridge we're measuring
vibrations and then measuring the response
of the structure to those vibrations.
With so much traffic going over it and wind
and other things going on so to extract
some meaningful information we use
machine learning. It's a set of smart
algorithms, can take the raw data and
then tell you the performance of the
bridge. It's going to help understand the
ability of that asset to cope in
different conditions and really maximize
the productivity and efficiency. Really
brings together distributed sensors,
communication networking technologies,
smart algorithms and data visualization
suited to our customers needs.
The next steps for us at Data 61 is to work
with Cisco through innovation central
taking all of our learning from the Sydney
Harbour Bridge and packaging it up in a way
thats scalable, can be marketed to
different segments and can apply to
different sized structures through
Australia and the world.
[Music]
I see a connected world, an Internet of
Things world and the ability to
connect and understand our
infrastructure is going to be
Key to that. This technology will
help us do that.

#### Module 1: What in the world is the Internet of Things?   1.3 IoT case studies   IoT case study: Agriculture - Dairy farm

https://youtu.be/R8qDvk2NgMo

MALCOLM HAYES: I'm Malcolm Hayes.
I'm a dairy farmer from Cookernup in Western Australia.
The property here, our home property or what we call our dairy platform,
is about 240 hectares.
Presently, we're milking about 360 cows in the dairy,
producing about three and a half million liters of milk a year.
Last year about this time, after a lot of searching around
for a better system, we decided to go with a GEA cow management system
where we installed milk monitors and automatic ID systems on our cows,
which it's actually reducing the labor that we need to use in the dairy.
And we're actually managing the cows a lot better than we did before.
With the better management, we're certainly getting our cows in calf
better, as we have a system to identify cows which are on heat.
[MOO]
All of the cows have a responder on, them
which is a thing which has a motion sensor in it and a transponder in it
to actually register the, so the computer
can read the cow's number as the cow comes in the dairy.
This is how we know what goes on individually with each cow.
If a cow gets sick and milk drops off, alarms will come up in the dairy.
And we'll know straight away.
If she stops eating because there's no motion or lack of motion in the cow,
we'll know straight away.
It even has an app that goes to my phone that I
can look up the cows when I'm away.

#### Module 1: What in the world is the Internet of Things?   1.3 IoT case studies   IoT case study: Health - Foot drop project

CASE STUDY: Foot Drop
The third case study we will be using examines a health application of the IoT - using sensors on patients with a gait abnormality known as foot drop. 

Please watch the following video for an introduction to this case study.

https://youtu.be/u0HMjMDctZ4

SHIVA SHARIF BIDABADI: So I'm Shiva.
I'm doing post-grad studies in Department of Electrical
and Computer Engineering of Curtin.
My project is trying to find a way or a system
to be used in early identification of abnormalities in the walking gait
patterns.
Dropping of the forefoot happens due to the different reasons.
For example, weakness in the muscles or pressure on the nerve.
This problem, foot drop can cause different problems for old people,
for example.
They can be ended up in falling to the ground.
But in young persons can cause problems such as limitation in the sports
and those kind of things.
So what we are trying to do is having a device
to capture these movements from the patients
once they come into the clinical area.
But in future, one of the future steps of the project
can be having this device get used at home
during the daily activities of the subjects,
once they are doing their normal daily movements.
And this system can be directly connect to the internet
and the data can be captured.
This system is going to be a user-friendly system, which
is low in cost and also portable and lightweight
to be used by the patients or old people.
So comparing to the previous methods of gait analyzing,
it's way cheaper and more easy to use.

#### Module 1: What in the world is the Internet of Things?   1.3 IoT case studies   IoT case study: Industry - Smart monitoring and asset management

CASE STUDY: IoT Applications in Industry
Please watch the following video introducing our fourth case study, where we hear from Professor Ian Howard of Curtin University about IoT applications in industry, such as smart monitoring, and maintenance and asset management. 

https://youtu.be/5Zth7sumQD4

IAN HOWARD: I come to this research area, or Internet of Things area,
from the point of view of rotating equipment.
So if we think about industry, there's all kinds of pumps, compressors,
turbines, gearboxes, and bore mills.
The amount of rotating machinery that we have is really very vast.
How do you actually know when things need maintaining?
You either work on a time schedule basis, but if you try to save money
and trying to do maintenance smarter, then really what you should be doing
is on a predictive condition monitoring basis.
That requires the use of sensors.
Sensors that actually measure the behavior of the equipment.
And you want to be able to transmit that information,
communicate that information, back to the web or to the internet
and then be able to analyze that and be able to use
that to understand what is happening.
So wind turbines designed to last more than 20 years
but it needs to be maintained well.
In the earlier days, the wind turbines, well, the maintenance procedures,
would be on a time schedule basis.
What we have now is the ability to actually continuously monitor
the system in real time.
Then it's only when something is in need of replacement
that you actually do the replacement.
Let's say that the wind turbine suffers a lightning strike.
And the lightning propagates through the blade
and because the blade is a composite fiber material,
it's possible that the lightning strike could actually introduce
some delamination in the blade.
So, if you have vibration sensors on the blade,
you have strain gage sensors on the blade for example,
then in real time you're able to detect, OK there's
actually been a change in operating condition now.
And then over time you can monitor that change and can progress.
That change can progress.
So it's vitally important that before that portion of a blade flies off,
travels hundreds of meters potentially killing somebody,
that you actually stop the turbine, replace the blade.
The same thing for the bearings in the gearbox, for example.
Wind turbines have a history of burning down.
Which sounds very weird, but you can see evidence of wind turbines
burning because the bearings in the gears
get so damaged that they just heat up so much and that the oil starts to burn
and the whole thing literally burns down.
By monitoring the bearing condition and the gearbox condition then
you can actually alert the maintainers, the operators,
that something needs to be fixed.
And you can actually predict weeks and weeks, sometimes months in advance,
when it needs to be maintained.
I've got a PhD student looking at asset tracking in the health sector
and there's different opportunities there
in hospitals as well as in age care.
They might be aware.
OK, they already have like 500 chairs for patients
to use, for visitors to use.
They know they have them-- they purchased them--
but then you ask them, OK, where are those chairs?
They actually don't know.
At any particular point in time, at the moment,
they're not able to tell you where their assets are.
That led us to do some research into the various means of asset tracking,
using smart tags for example, which can connect
to Wi-Fi devices, Bluetooth devices, or LoRaWAN devices.
So that's some research that's currently going on.
Asset tracking has added benefits because if you
can develop a smart tag on the asset, the smart tag
itself can have sensors inbuilt in the asset.
So now you have an asset, which has a tag on there,
and you also have sensors on the tag.
That can be embedded in the asset so that not only do you
know where the asset is but you can do some condition monitoring or patient
monitoring.
So you can actually introduce the concept of patient quality care
into the asset itself.
