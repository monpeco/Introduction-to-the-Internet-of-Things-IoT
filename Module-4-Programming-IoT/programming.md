#### Module 4: Programming IoT   4.0 Introduction   Programming IoT

In the previous module we looked at how 'things' get networked. In this module we will look at how IoT creates Big Data and how that can be handled, along with all the software programming that supports IoT solutions.

By the end of this Module you will be able to:

Recognise where programming is needed in the IoT process;
Examine programming logic and identify key programming languages;
Develop a definition of Big Data and its defining characteristics.

What is programming?
Most of you probably have some understanding of programming which is, essentially, the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task or sequence of tasks. The engineering practice of computer programming is primarily concerned with discovering and implementing the most efficient algorithms to address a specific class of problem.

Computer programming entails the use of a variety of programming languages. Later in this Module we will look at what determines the languages that are used to meet specific requirements.
