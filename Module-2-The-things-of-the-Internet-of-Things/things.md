#### Module 2: The 'things' of the Internet of Things   2.0 Introduction   Sensors and actuators


### Sensors and actuators

In Module 1, you gained a good understanding of what the Internet of Things refers to, and its enormous scope to help increase safety and create efficiencies.

In this module, you will:

* learn about the many 'end devices' that give the IoT the ability to physically sense and respond in different circumstances;
* understand the role and function of sensors and actuators in the IoT.

To get started, we will be talking about two key IoT components - sensors and actuators.

* **Sensor**: A sensor detects changes in its environment and sends information about that change.
* **Actuator**: An actuator moves or controls something.

Watch the following video, where our everyman finds out more about sensors and actuators, and how they work.
