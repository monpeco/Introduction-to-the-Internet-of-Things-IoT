#### Module 2: The 'things' of the Internet of Things   2.0 Introduction   Sensors and actuators


### Sensors and actuators

In Module 1, you gained a good understanding of what the Internet of Things refers to, and its enormous scope to help increase safety and create efficiencies.

In this module, you will:

* learn about the many 'end devices' that give the IoT the ability to physically sense and respond in different circumstances;
* understand the role and function of sensors and actuators in the IoT.

To get started, we will be talking about two key IoT components - sensors and actuators.

* **Sensor**: A sensor detects changes in its environment and sends information about that change.
* **Actuator**: An actuator moves or controls something.

Watch the following video, where our everyman finds out more about sensors and actuators, and how they work.

#### Module 2: The 'things' of the Internet of Things   2.0 Introduction   Introduction to Module 2

https://youtu.be/dBG38-snCnM

IAIN MURRAY: Welcome back.
I'm Iain Murray.
And we're now looking at the sensors and devices section of the course,
or things as we would rather call them.
So you may be wondering where we're talking about The Internet of Things.
What is a thing?
Well, this is a thing.
This is a sensor.
It's a sensor that reads something about the environment.
We can read many things.
We can read gas level, CO2, humidity, temperature.
Lots of different items.
This is also a thing.
It's a speaker.
It's something that has an output.
So if you look at them together we have a sensor, which is an input,
and an actuator, which is an output.
In this case, a speaker, or it could be a motor,
or it could be a relay or something else that performs an action.
They need to be connected to a computer.
And generally we use very small computers like this one.
This is a microcontroller.
And this is a device that reads the input from the sensor
and can output some action to the actuator.
So if we look at our microcontroller, our input sensor, and our actuator,
and we put these together that is a thing.
And this is the thing that we connect to the internet.
Of particular interest this is a really small thing,
but you can also have very large things.
If you look at the case study later on of the engineering
pavilion at Curtin University that is a thing on the internet.
So an Internet of Things, thing, but that is not small.
It's a three storey building.
So we tend to talk about devices and things.
These terms can be used somewhat interchangeably.
A thing, as we've mentioned, is a sensor or an actuator
connected to a small computer that reads something about the environment
or acts on an element within that environment.
A device, we tend to, and this is not always true,
but we tend to talk about this sort of thing as a device.
It's something that has other uses, is intelligent, but it contains sensors,
it contains the communication methods that we
need for the Internet of Things, but it serves other purposes.
So it becomes a device.
So we've had a chat about the device and things
that we'll be examining in this course.
So let's go in and we'll explore a few of the different types of sensors
that are available to us.

#### Module 2: The 'things' of the Internet of Things   2.1 What sort of 'things' are we talking about?   IoT streamlining mining operations

Watch the following Cisco video about how IoT is streamlining mining operations by using sensing devices to monitor functions.

https://youtu.be/-p0SczRLRZI

[MUSIC PLAYING]
SPEAKER 1: Today's mining operations comprise
a series of disparate siloed environments,
from extraction and automation systems to port and rail and track automation.
Each environment presents its own challenges
and mainly operates independently using proprietary data sources and networks.
You need a holistic view of your entire mining operations
that leads to better visibility and traceability
while letting you take advantage of rich IP
enabled technologies in each environment.
Working with industry leading partners, Cisco can help fully connect
and integrate all of your operational environments,
removing the barriers to efficiency created by siloed networks.
But it doesn't stop there.
Cisco takes an integrated approach, converging your existing enterprise
systems with this new consolidated operational technology, or OT network.
The result is a fully connected and converged pit-to-port network
that enables lean, efficient, collaborative, safe, and highly
secure operations while helping you keep your costs down and your profits up.
With Cisco Solutions for Mining, you can improve performance and efficiency
at all stages of operations to reduce downtime, better manage and schedule
your fleet and assets, wherever or whatever they may be,
increase security to control access to restricted areas and your assets,
and most importantly, better ensure the safety of both
your employees and the environment.
And you can do all of this while connecting your teams and assets
collaboratively around the world.
Here are just a few examples.
In mining operations, downtime is the enemy,
and an idle truck can cost hundreds of thousands per day.
Cisco Solutions for Mining help automate operations for maximum efficiency
by leveraging the Internet of Things, where
every device interacts with each other and turns information into action.
That means critical elements on a truck, from engine components to tire
pressure, can be monitored both onboard and remotely,
enabling predictive maintenance.
Cab sensors monitor drivers for alertness,
and should a driver become tired, automatically
notify both the driver and a remote operation center.
Monitors can also remotely alert vehicles approaching a pit too quickly,
helping to ensure the safety of the driver and others working in the pit.
Real-time remote monitoring and scheduling of all machines and vehicles
is possible at every operation phase, from excavation,
to raw material movement, to delivery.
Cisco's Solutions for Mining also help to create a zero-harm environment
for personnel and surrounding areas.
This includes using RFID tags to track miners and machinery underground
at all times.
If there's an incident, each worker can be located in minutes.
Similarly, gas monitor systems help enable remote real-time gas detection,
so personnel and responders can be alerted to up to the minute conditions.
Even with mining operations located in remote areas,
malicious attacks can still occur at any time.
Cisco Solutions for Mining add both physical and cyber security
to your infrastructure, helping to protect your operations and assets
from both internal and external threats.
And Cisco Solutions for Mining let the mining operators remotely collaborate
on ideas and solutions with your office personnel, outside maintenance crews,
and third party engineering companies from around the world without ever
leaving the site.

#### Module 2: The 'things' of the Internet of Things   2.1 What sort of 'things' are we talking about?   IoT case study: Dairy farm


https://youtu.be/pDbnhJOMiks

Well, all of the cows have a responder on them,
which is a thing which has a motion sensor in it,
and it also has a transponder in it.
Well, it's very robust design.
They're very strong, because the cows aren't very easy on them.
They knock them around.
They hook their collars on trees sometimes and try to pull them off.
They've got a very strong collar.
It's fairly easy to fit.
They've got a battery in them.
They've got a five-year life of the battery.
After that five years, you have to buy a new responder.
They're $140 each, so we need to get value out of them.
The data from the motion sensor is sent back to the dairy herd.
It's sent back to the computer, so that we know which cows are on heat
or which cows are ill and not moving.
If the cows are on heat, they tend to run around a lot more.
And they actually eat a bit less, because they spend all their time
running around after other cows.
And the computer will pick this up and show us a spike on the graph.
And we'll look up the graph of the cow and find
that if she's had a heat period 21 days before or 18 to 24 days before hand,
we'll know that, that was her previous heat
and this is a pretty good chance this is actually a heat and not
some other incident.
And then we'll make the decision to mate that cow.
We've got a drafting system in the dairy where the computer will actually
draft those cows off, because it knows that those cows are on heat.
And then we just need to check up on the reasons why it drafted the cow out
and make sure that she's just on heat.
With the conductivity sensors we have in the dairy,
that lets us know when the cows got mastitis.
Their milk conductivity increases.
It becomes more conductive.
So it will show a spike in the graph.
And when it has a spike in their graph, the alarms will come on in the dairy,
and we need to go and test that cow.
And we'll actually do a physical test on the cow to see if she's got mastitis.
And if she has then we'll treat her and deal with the problem.
It just makes our mastitis treatment a lot easier.
And we're able to pick up cows very quickly,
and treat them before the mastitis gets hold of them.
And actually, cure a lot of the cows that previously we weren't curing,
because they'd had mastitis too long before we detected them.
One of the things with the actual activity meter is, if a cows not eating
and we know she's in the herd, we know that cow's sick.
And we need to actually identify her when she comes in the herd
and draft her out.
The numbers attached to the cow, which is this number here,
attached to this responder.
I programmed this one to draft the gates.
As the cows walk through the antenna like this one here, the ID is read.
And then the gates on here, hopefully, will work.
[CHUCKLE] And then the gates will open and close,
and we'll draft off the cow into wherever we want to go.
This is a dairy parlor in the dairy.
We have the computer monitors behind each cow.
There's a whole heap of data comes on behind each cow,
so that we can find out different things that we need to do with that cow.
This particular cow, is a cow with high somatic cell
count, which we divert her milk out of the system and feed it to the calves.
And we have a separate line being this line here,
which we attach to the milk line from the cups just like that,
and seal the thing off.
So we're not using the milk meters here.
So to put this cow on, because the computers recognize her
as a cow that's not to be put on line, if I lift the cups up here,
it won't activate the cups.
I can't actually put those out there and put them on the cow.
So I have to go through a process of pushing these buttons here
to activate the machine, so I can put that on the cow,
which we will be out here.
With the other sets of cups, I just have to lift them up and put them
straight on.
And same to take the cups off the cow, because it
won't come off automatically.
So we have to do it manually.
These here are our milk meters, which actually tell us how much milk the cow
is giving each time.
As the cow's come in here, the transponder reads the cow number.
And it knows where the cows are in the dairy, so from lots one to 20.
And this is position number 20 here, or 19, or whatever.
So it knows that cow number 10 is in position number 19.
And she's got to have two kilos of grain.
It will automatically drop two kilos of grain out of that particular feeder
for that cow to have.
And we do that so that we've got cows that are on 20 liters,
they'll only have two kilos.
20 liters of milk will only have two liters of grain.
And a cow that's on 45 liters of milk, I think she's on seven kilos of grain,
so she'll get seven kilos of grain dropped for her.
But that's in a day.
So she coming in, in her first one, she only get three and 1/2 kilos,
and then another three and 1/2 at the night time milking.
The equipment we have here has allowed us to milk more numbers
without having to employ more staff.
And that we're managing things better.
And to manage those cows, a lot better that we are milking.

#### Module 2: The 'things' of the Internet of Things   2.1 What sort of 'things' are we talking about?   IoT case study: Gait analysis

https://youtu.be/Uhjl9-ImVaM

SHIVA SHARIF BIDABADI: This system which has
been designed for this specific study is a kind
of a device using three separate IMU devices placed
in three color coded 3D printed boxes.
And the sensors will be attached to the different sections of the lower limb.
For example, in this case, thigh, shank, and foot off the subject.
And the data from this device will be captured simultaneously
to the receiver dongle that connects to the laptop
and collects the data from the devices.
Having this device attached to the body section,
we can provide some information about the movement
of that section of the body.
For example, angle of the thigh during the walking trial.
For example, positive and negative movements in the whole gait cycle.
The sensors in the devices are Inertial Measurement Units
which is a kind of sensor that consists of accelerometer gyroscope,
and magnetometer in a single unit that provides a good range of information
about the movement.
Each three devices have the same sensor inside them, just numbered.
Accelerometer actually reads the acceleration of the device.
for the angle of velocity in different directions, x, y, and z.
And a magnetometer also looks for the magnetic field in the area.
It could get noise easily by any magnetic field near the sensor.
But in general, the readings that we're going
to have from the inertial measurement unit is the acceleration in three axes,
the magnetic field in three axis and also the angle
of velocity in three different axis.

#### Module 2: The 'things' of the Internet of Things   2.1 What sort of 'things' are we talking about?   IoT case study: Self-powering remote sensors

https://youtu.be/sLBmLMSlEw4

IAN HOWARD: How do you actually know when things need maintaining?
You either work on a time-schedule basis--
but if you try to save money and try to do maintenance smarter, then
really what you should be doing is on a predictive-condition monitoring basis.
And so that requires the use of sensors--
sensors that actually measure the behavior of the equipment--
can be vibration sensors--
can be pressure-- can be strain gauges--
can be sound microphone sensors.
So these sensors, traditionally, are very expensive,
but now you can get really quite cheap sensors.
And as far as The Internet of Things goes, what you really want to do
is to have those sensors embedded in the equipment with its own power supply
or battery supply or renewable energy--
energy harvesting supply, and then have some means
of digitizing that signature--
whether it's pressure or strain or accelerometer--
acceleration-- and then to be able to communicate that sensor
information to the web.
That's really where the Internet of Things comes in.
So I have here an example of a sensor that we put together
more than 15 years ago.
And this was designed to fit onto large rotating equipment.
And it has inbuilt in there a MEMS transducer, which
measures the acceleration, and also has a thermometer to measure
the temperature of the device.
So when we developed this, we realized that okay the concept really
would be to embed these into remote machines
and often in places that are not very accessible.
So you really don't want to have these battery powered
and then every three months have to actually replace the batteries.
So that brought us into the research topic of energy harvesting.
And there are many different types of energy
we can extract from the environment--
for example, solar or wind energy.
But we've been working-- because we're looking
at vibration-- we've been working on energy harvesting from the vibration
environment.
And there are different techniques for extracting energy,
but we've been looking particularly at the piezoelectric energy harvesting.
So I've got an example here of a piezoelectric beam
that can be used for that.
Here is a miniature piezoelectric beam.
And it would be clamped to the machine.
So it's base-excited vibration, and this beam then vibrates back and forwards.
So what we find is per meter per second squared--
or per g-- you can extract fractions of a milliwatt of energy
from these devices if they're operating at resonance.
Now a fraction of a milliwatt might not sound very much.
But actually, because it's generating power continuously,
over the days, weeks, and months, you accumulate a lot of energy.
And so, then, you can couple that with smart supercapacitors
or other recharging devices to recharge your batteries and so on, which
gives you enough energy-- enough power to be
able to communicate that information from the sensor-- from the smart sensor
to the internet or to the web.
So there's a vast array of applications now
in industry for these kinds of devices.

#### Module 2: The 'things' of the Internet of Things   2.1 What sort of 'things' are we talking about?   IoT case study: Autonomous bus

https://youtu.be/x9l-K6rTYvg

PAUL NICHOLLS: For a vehicle to become fully autonomous,
it needs to take over the roles and responsibility of a human.
In a normal car, a human would be doing lots of things.
They'd be detecting the information that's coming in.
They'd be steering the vehicle.
They'd be controlling the accelerator and the brakes.
In an autonomous vehicle, all of those things are taken away from the human.
Instead, the bus is actually detecting what's happening around it.
It's making the decisions about how it turns,
and it's controlling the technologies on the bus to get us from point A
to point B.
IMAN KAREEM: So one of the main sensors that we use for Kip is 360 Lidar.
So basically how Lidar works, it's very similar to radar,
except that it shoots out laser beams, 360 degrees.
And so, based on that, it's able to tell--
Kip is able to tell how far objects are and where objects are, relative
to its position.
Similar to the 360 Lidar, we have 2D Lidars down at the bottom.
And what it does is that it can see objects in front of it--
for example, people walking or a car in front of it.
And, based on that, Kip is able to tell when to stop or when to slow down.
We also do have stereo cameras over here.
So hopefully we will be able to read stop signs and red lights.
The bus is actually completely bidirectional,
so it can go 45 kilometers on that side and on this side.
So what do we see over here?
The sensors.
We have exactly on the other side.
Much like the front and the back, we do have a 2D Lidar on the sides.
So that's basically to detect how far the curb is,
how far the bus stop is, so that it's really close,
so that people can get on.
And on the wheels we have sensors, to actually know
how fast each wheel is moving.
And, based on that, Kip's accuracy to the ground is centimeter-perfect.
So the sensors that we see over here, the Lidars and the cameras,
are actually plugged in directly to the systems onboard.
And, in addition to that, we have GPS, 4G, 3G, radio, and Wi-Fi,
which connect wirelessly to networks around campus,
to aid its location positioning.
So the reason why we use quite a few technologies to aid its positioning
is so that, if one were to go down, we have quite a few backups.

#### Module 2: The 'things' of the Internet of Things   2.2 Sensors and actuators   Sensors in your smart phone

### Sensors in your smart phone

A smart phone touch screen works through one of these sensor types:

* capacitive
* resistive
* surface acoustic sensor. 

The touch screen allows interaction with all phone functions and Apps, and some game Apps use the capability for play.

A typical smart phone contains many sensors of various types, and is generally internet capable. A few of the most common sensors include:

* Magnetometer: Detects magnetic fields
* Accelerometer: Detects the movement of the phone
* Gyroscope: Detects a change in the phone’s orientation

In most cases these sensors generate data and deal with it in the phone itself. In an IoT scenario, the data generated by a sensor is sent out into a network. This may or may not involve a message or command for action coming back to the phone.

#### Module 2: The 'things' of the Internet of Things   2.2 Sensors and actuators   Phone as an IoT device

### Phone as an IoT device

An App called Physics Toolbox Sensor Suite is available for Android and iPhone and can show you all the sensors on your phone. It also allows you to see live data being collected from them.

A similar App, available in the App store is [Power Sense: Motion Sensor](https://appadvice.com/app/powersense-motion-sensor-data-logging-tool/1050491381).

And [Wyliodrin](https://www.wyliodrin.com/) on Android can detect what sensors your phone has.

**READING**
Abhayasinghe, N. and Murray 1. 2014. "Human activity recognition using thigh angle derived from single thigh mounted IMU data." 2014 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation, 27th-30th October 2014,  https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nimsiri_Abhayasinghe/publication/267626403_Human_Activity_Recognition_Using_Thigh_Angle_Derived_from_Single_Thigh_Mounted_IMU_Data/links/545430580cf26d5090a55904/Human-Activity-Recognition-Using-Thigh-Angle-Derived-from-Single-Thigh-Mounted-IMU-Data.pdf
This paper looks at using an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensor in a phone to measure thigh angle, to be able to tell what someone is doing (sitting, standing, cycling, walking, etc.) for the purpose of assisting vision-impaired people with indoor navigation. When a person changes position, the sensor senses the small changes in atmospheric pressure, rather than the more commonly used accelerometer with magnetometer, to detect movement.

**DISCUSSION QUESTION**
On the discussion board below, tell the group what sensor (whether or not it exists) you would like to see in your phone, and for what purpose. Add whether it would need connectivity to a network for your desired purpose.

Alternatively, share an idea for using an existing phone sensor for an IoT-type App.

For a look at what sensors exist go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sensors.

We encourage you to comment on other learners’ ideas.
