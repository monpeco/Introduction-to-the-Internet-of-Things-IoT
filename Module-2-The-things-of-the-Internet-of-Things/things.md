#### Module 2: The 'things' of the Internet of Things   2.0 Introduction   Sensors and actuators


### Sensors and actuators

In Module 1, you gained a good understanding of what the Internet of Things refers to, and its enormous scope to help increase safety and create efficiencies.

In this module, you will:

* learn about the many 'end devices' that give the IoT the ability to physically sense and respond in different circumstances;
* understand the role and function of sensors and actuators in the IoT.

To get started, we will be talking about two key IoT components - sensors and actuators.

* **Sensor**: A sensor detects changes in its environment and sends information about that change.
* **Actuator**: An actuator moves or controls something.

Watch the following video, where our everyman finds out more about sensors and actuators, and how they work.

IAIN MURRAY: Welcome back.
I'm Iain Murray.
And we're now looking at the sensors and devices section of the course,
or things as we would rather call them.
So you may be wondering where we're talking about The Internet of Things.
What is a thing?
Well, this is a thing.
This is a sensor.
It's a sensor that reads something about the environment.
We can read many things.
We can read gas level, CO2, humidity, temperature.
Lots of different items.
This is also a thing.
It's a speaker.
It's something that has an output.
So if you look at them together we have a sensor, which is an input,
and an actuator, which is an output.
In this case, a speaker, or it could be a motor,
or it could be a relay or something else that performs an action.
They need to be connected to a computer.
And generally we use very small computers like this one.
This is a microcontroller.
And this is a device that reads the input from the sensor
and can output some action to the actuator.
So if we look at our microcontroller, our input sensor, and our actuator,
and we put these together that is a thing.
And this is the thing that we connect to the internet.
Of particular interest this is a really small thing,
but you can also have very large things.
If you look at the case study later on of the engineering
pavilion at Curtin University that is a thing on the internet.
So an Internet of Things, thing, but that is not small.
It's a three storey building.
So we tend to talk about devices and things.
These terms can be used somewhat interchangeably.
A thing, as we've mentioned, is a sensor or an actuator
connected to a small computer that reads something about the environment
or acts on an element within that environment.
A device, we tend to, and this is not always true,
but we tend to talk about this sort of thing as a device.
It's something that has other uses, is intelligent, but it contains sensors,
it contains the communication methods that we
need for the Internet of Things, but it serves other purposes.
So it becomes a device.
So we've had a chat about the device and things
that we'll be examining in this course.
So let's go in and we'll explore a few of the different types of sensors
that are available to us.

#### Module 2: The 'things' of the Internet of Things   2.1 What sort of 'things' are we talking about?   IoT streamlining mining operations

Watch the following Cisco video about how IoT is streamlining mining operations by using sensing devices to monitor functions.

SPEAKER 1: Today's mining operations comprise
a series of disparate siloed environments,
from extraction and automation systems to port and rail and track automation.
Each environment presents its own challenges
and mainly operates independently using proprietary data sources and networks.
You need a holistic view of your entire mining operations
that leads to better visibility and traceability
while letting you take advantage of rich IP
enabled technologies in each environment.
Working with industry leading partners, Cisco can help fully connect
and integrate all of your operational environments,
removing the barriers to efficiency created by siloed networks.
But it doesn't stop there.
Cisco takes an integrated approach, converging your existing enterprise
systems with this new consolidated operational technology, or OT network.
The result is a fully connected and converged pit-to-port network
that enables lean, efficient, collaborative, safe, and highly
secure operations while helping you keep your costs down and your profits up.
With Cisco Solutions for Mining, you can improve performance and efficiency
at all stages of operations to reduce downtime, better manage and schedule
your fleet and assets, wherever or whatever they may be,
increase security to control access to restricted areas and your assets,
and most importantly, better ensure the safety of both
your employees and the environment.
And you can do all of this while connecting your teams and assets
collaboratively around the world.
Here are just a few examples.
In mining operations, downtime is the enemy,
and an idle truck can cost hundreds of thousands per day.
Cisco Solutions for Mining help automate operations for maximum efficiency
by leveraging the Internet of Things, where
every device interacts with each other and turns information into action.
That means critical elements on a truck, from engine components to tire
pressure, can be monitored both onboard and remotely,
enabling predictive maintenance.
Cab sensors monitor drivers for alertness,
and should a driver become tired, automatically
notify both the driver and a remote operation center.
Monitors can also remotely alert vehicles approaching a pit too quickly,
helping to ensure the safety of the driver and others working in the pit.
Real-time remote monitoring and scheduling of all machines and vehicles
is possible at every operation phase, from excavation,
to raw material movement, to delivery.
Cisco's Solutions for Mining also help to create a zero-harm environment
for personnel and surrounding areas.
This includes using RFID tags to track miners and machinery underground
at all times.
If there's an incident, each worker can be located in minutes.
Similarly, gas monitor systems help enable remote real-time gas detection,
so personnel and responders can be alerted to up to the minute conditions.
Even with mining operations located in remote areas,
malicious attacks can still occur at any time.
Cisco Solutions for Mining add both physical and cyber security
to your infrastructure, helping to protect your operations and assets
from both internal and external threats.
And Cisco Solutions for Mining let the mining operators remotely collaborate
on ideas and solutions with your office personnel, outside maintenance crews,
and third party engineering companies from around the world without ever
leaving the site.
